Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others. To share files through Samba, see #Server section; to access files shared through Samba on other machines, please see #Client section. Server Installation Install the package. Samba is configured in the configuration file, which is extensively documented in . Because the package does not provide this file, one needs to create it before starting . A documented example as in from the Samba git repository may be used to setup . Enabling and starting services To provide basic file sharing through SMB, enable/start . See for details. If you want to make your server accessible via NetBIOS host name, set the desired name in the option in and enable/start . See for details. Make the server discoverable Install the package, then enable/start to make the samba server discoverable with Zeroconf . It should work for most non-Windows file managers (macOS Finder, various GUI-based file managers on Linux & BSD etc.) If is not running, the server will still be accessible, just not discoverable, i.e. it will not show up in file managers, but you can still connect to the server directly by IP or domain. Windows Explorer relies on the WS-Discovery protocol instead; see #Windows 1709 or up does not discover the samba server in Network view . Configure firewall If you are using a firewall , do not forget to open required ports (usually 137-139 + 445). For a complete list, see Samba port usage . UFW Rule A Ufw App Profile for SMB/CIFS is included by default with the default installation of UFW in . Allow Samba by running as root. If you deleted the profile, create/edit and add the following content: [Samba] title=LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix description=The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol. ports=137,138/udp|139,445/tcp Then load the profile into UFW run as root. Then finally, allow Samba by running as root. firewalld service To configure firewalld to allow Samba in the home zone, run: # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service={samba,samba-client,samba-dc} --zone=home The three services listed are: : for sharing files with others. : to browse shares on other machines on the network. : for Samba/Active Directory domain controller . ensures the changes remain after is restarted . Basic configuration User management The following section describes creating a local (tdbsam) database of Samba users. For user authentication and other purposes, Samba can also be bound to an Active Directory domain, can itself serve as an Active Directory domain controller, or can be used with an LDAP server. Adding a user Samba requires a Linux user account - you may use an existing user account or create a new one . Although the user name is shared with Linux system, Samba uses a password separate from that of the Linux user accounts. Replace with the chosen Samba user account: # smbpasswd -a samba_user Depending on the server role , existing File permissions and attributes may need to be altered for the Samba user account. If you want the new user only to be allowed to remotely access the file server shares through Samba, you can restrict other login options\uff1a disabling shell - disabling SSH logons - edit , change option Also see Security for hardening your system. Listing users Samba users can be listed using the command: # pdbedit -L -v Changing user password To change a user password, use : # smbpasswd samba_user Creating an anonymous share 1. Create a Linux user which anonymous Samba users will be mapped to. # useradd guest -s /bin/nologin 2. Add the following to : Anonymous users will now be mapped to the Linux user and have the ability to access any directories defined in , which is configured to be in the example above. Make sure that the Linux user has the proper permissions to access files in . Also, make sure shares have been properly defined as per the Share Definitions section of smb.conf.default . Advanced configuration Enable symlink following Then, restart . Enable server-side copy for macOS clients Server-side copy eliminates the need to transfer data between the server and the client when copying files on the server. This is enabled by default, but it doesn't work with macOS clients. If you have macOS clients, you need to add the following configuration to and then restart . Enable Usershares Usershares is a feature that gives non-root users the capability to add, modify, and delete their own share definitions. See . Create a directory for usershares: Create a user group : Change the owner of the directory to and the group to : Change the permissions of the directory so that users in the group can create files. This command also sets sticky bit , which is important to prevent users from deleting usershares of other users: Set the following parameters in the configuration file: Add the user to the sambashare group. Replace with the name of your user: # gpasswd sambashare -a your_username Restart and services. Log out and log back in. If you want to share paths inside your home directory you must make it accessible for the group others . In the GUI, you can use Thunar or Dolphin - right click on any directory and share it on the network. In the CLI, use one of the following commands, replacing italic sharename , user , ... : # net usershare add sharename abspath [ comment ] [ user :{R|D|F}] [guest_ok={y|n}] # net usershare delete sharename # net usershare list wildcard-sharename # net usershare info wildcard-sharename Set and forcing permissions Permissions may be applied to both the server and shares: See for a full overview of possible permission flags and settings. Restrict protocols for better security Append and in to force usage of a minimum and maximum protocol: See in for an overview of supported protocols. For compatibility with older clients and/or servers, you might need to set or , but please note that this makes you vulnerable to exploits in SMB1 including ransomware attacks. Clients using may need to specify the correct , e.g.: # mount -t cifs // SERVER / sharename /mnt/ mountpoint -o username= username ,password= password ,iocharset= utf8 ,vers= 3.1.1 See for more information. Use native SMB transport encryption Native SMB transport encryption is available in SMB version 3.0 or newer. Clients supporting this type of encryption include Windows 8 and newer, Windows server 2012 and newer, and smbclient of Samba 4.1 and newer. To use native SMB transport encryption by default, set the parameter globally and/or by share. Possible values are , (default value), , or : To configure encryption for on the client side, use the option . See for more information, especially the paragraphs Effects for SMB1 and Effects for SMB2 . Disable printer sharing By default Samba shares printers configured using CUPS . If you do not want printers to be shared, use the following settings: Block certain file extensions on Samba share Samba offers an option to block files with certain patterns, like file extensions. This option can be used to prevent dissemination of viruses or to dissuade users from wasting space with certain files. More information about this option can be found in . Improve throughput The default settings should be sufficient for most users. However setting the 'socket options' correct can improve performance, but getting them wrong can degrade it by just as much. Test the effect before making any large changes. Read the man page before applying any of the options listed below. The following settings should be appended to the section of . Setting a deadtime is useful to stop a server's resources from being exhausted by a large number of inactive connections: deadtime = 30 The usage of sendfile may make more efficient use of the system CPU's and cause Samba to be faster: use sendfile = yes Setting min receivefile size allows zero-copy writes directly from network socket buffers into the filesystem buffer cache (if available). It may improve performance but user testing is recommended: min receivefile size = 16384 Increasing the receive/send buffers size and socket optimize flags might be useful to improve throughput. It is recommended to test each flag separately as it may cause issues on some networks: socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_THROUGHPUT SO_RCVBUF=131072 SO_SNDBUF=131072 Enable access for old clients/devices Latest versions of Samba no longer offer older authentication methods and protocols which are still used by some older clients (IP cameras, etc). These devices usually require Samba server to allow NTMLv1 authentication and NT1 version of the protocol, known as CIFS. For these devices to work with latest Samba, you need to add these two configuration parameters into section: server min protocol = NT1 ntlm auth = yes Anonymous/guest access to a share requires just the first parameter. If the old device will access with username and password, you also need the add the second line too. Enable Spotlight searching Spotlight allows supporting clients (e.g. MacOS Finder) to quickly search shared files. Install and start/enable OpenSearch . Install , configure the directories you want to index in , and start/enable for periodic indexing. Edit as described in the Samba wiki to enable Spotlight per share, and restart to apply the changes. Client Install for an -like command line interface. See for commonly used commands. For a lightweight alternative (without support for listing public shares, etc.), install that provides . Depending on the desktop environment , GUI methods may be available. See #File manager configuration for use with a file manager. List public shares The following command lists public shares on a server: $ smbclient -L hostname -U% Alternatively, running will show a tree diagram of all the shares. It uses broadcast queries and is therefore not advisable on a network with a lot of computers, but can be helpful for diagnosing if you have the correct sharename. The () option suppresses the password prompt. NetBIOS/WINS host names Samba clients handle NetBIOS host names automatically by default (the behavior is controlled by the option in ). Other programs (including ) typically use Name Service Switch , which does not handle NetBIOS by default. The package provides a libnss driver to resolve NetBIOS host names. To use it, install it along with the package (which provides the winbindd daemon), start/enable and add to the line in : Now, during host resolving (e.g. when using or just ), winbindd will resolve the host name by sending queries using NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS, also known as WINS) protocol. By default it sends a broadcast query to your local network. If you have a WINS server, you can add to and restart , then winbindd and other Samba clients will send unicast queries to the specified IP. If you want to resolve your local host name (specified in the option in ), start/enable , which will handle incoming queries. You can test WINS resolution with . By default it sends broadcast queries to your local network regardless of the option. Note that WINS resolution requires incoming traffic originating from port 137. Disable NetBIOS/WINS support When not using NetBIOS/WINS host name resolution, it may be preferred to disable this protocol: Finally disable / stop . Manual mounting Mount the share using as . Not all the options listed below are needed or desirable: # mount --mkdir -t cifs // SERVER / sharename /mnt/ mountpoint -o username= username ,password= password ,workgroup= workgroup ,iocharset= utf8 ,uid= username ,gid= group The options and corresponds to the local (e.g. client) user / user group to have read/write access on the given path. \u2014 The server name. \u2014 The shared directory. \u2014 The local directory where the share will be mounted. \u2014 See for more information. Storing share passwords Storing passwords in a world readable file is not recommended. A safer method is to use a credentials file instead, e.g. inside : For the mount command replace with . The credential file should explicitly readable/writeable to root: # chown root:root /etc/samba/credentials # chmod 700 /etc/samba/credentials # chmod 600 /etc/samba/credentials/share Automatic mounting Using NetworkManager and GIO/gvfs NetworkManager can be configured to run a script on network status change. This script uses the gio command so that it mounts the Samba shares automatically, the same way your file manager does, as explained below . The script also safely unmounts the Samba shares before the relevant network connection is disabled by listening for the and events. Make the script is executable after creating it. Create a symlink inside to catch the events: # ln -s /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/30-samba.sh /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d/30-samba.sh As mount entry This is a simple example of a mount entry that requires authentication: As systemd unit Create a new file inside , e.g. . See for details. path to share path to mount the share share mounting options To use , start the unit and enable it to run on system boot. automount To automatically mount a share (when accessed, like autofs), one may use the following automount unit: Disable / stop the unit, and enable / start to automount the share when the mount path is being accessed. smbnetfs First, check if you can see all the shares you are interested in mounting: $ smbtree -U remote_user If that does not work, find and modify the following line in accordingly: domain master = auto Now restart and . If everything works as expected, install . Then, add the following line to : user_allow_other Now copy the directory to your home directory: $ cp -a /etc/smbnetfs/.smb ~ Then create a link to : $ ln -sf /etc/samba/smb.conf ~/.smb/smb.conf If a username and a password are required to access some of the shared folders, edit to include one or more entries like this: It is also possible to add entries for specific hosts to be mounted by smbnetfs, if necessary. More details can be found in . If you are using the Dolphin or GNOME Files , you may want to add the following to to avoid \"Disk full\" errors as smbnetfs by default will report 0 bytes of free space: When you are done with the configuration, you need to run $ chmod 600 ~/.smb/smbnetfs.* Otherwise, smbnetfs complains about 'insecure config file permissions'. Finally, to mount your Samba network neighbourhood to a directory of your choice, call $ smbnetfs mount_point Daemon The Arch Linux package also maintains an additional system-wide operation mode for smbnetfs. To enable it, you need to make the said modifications in the directory . Then, you can start and/or enable the daemon as usual. The system-wide mount point is at . autofs See Autofs for information on the kernel-based automounter for Linux. File manager configuration GNOME Files, Nemo, Caja, Thunar and PCManFM In order to access samba shares through GNOME Files, Nemo, Caja, Thunar or PCManFM, install the package. Press and enter in the location bar to access your share. The mounted share is likely to be present at or in the filesystem. KDE KDE applications (like Dolphin) has the ability to browse Samba shares built in. Use the path to browse the files. If you want to access files from on non-KDE application, you can install . To use a GUI in the KDE System Settings, you will need to install the package. Other graphical environments There are a number of useful programs, but they may need to have packages created for them. This can be done with the Arch package build system. The good thing about these others is that they do not require a particular environment to be installed to support them, and so they bring along less baggage. LinNeighborhood, RUmba, xffm-samba plugin for Xffm are not available in the official repositories or the AUR. As they are not officially (or even unofficially supported), they may be obsolete and may not work at all. Tips and tricks Discovering network shares If nothing is known about other systems on the local network, and automated tools such as smbnetfs are not available, you can manually probe for Samba shares. First, install the and packages. Use nmap to scan your local network to find systems with TCP port 445 open, which is the port used by the SMB protocol. Note that you may need to use or set a custom ping scan type (e.g. ) because Windows systems are usually firewalled. The first result is another system; the second happens to be the client from where this scan was performed. Now you can connect to there IP addresses directly, but if you want to use NetBIOS host names, you can use to check for NetBIOS names. Note that this will not work if NetBIOS is disabled on the server. Regardless of the output, look for \\<20> , which shows the host with open services. Use to list which services are shared on these systems. You can use NetBIOS host name ( in this example) instead of IP when available. If prompted for a password, pressing enter should still display the list: Remote control of Windows computer Samba offers a set of tools for communication with Windows. These can be handy if access to a Windows computer through remote desktop is not an option, as shown by some examples. Send shutdown command with a comment: $ net rpc shutdown -C \"comment\" -I IPADDRESS -U USERNAME%PASSWORD A forced shutdown instead can be invoked by changing -C with comment to a single -f. For a restart, only add -r, followed by a -C or -f. Stop and start services: $ net rpc service stop SERVICENAME -I IPADDRESS -U USERNAME%PASSWORD To see all possible net rpc command: $ net rpc Troubleshooting Failed to start Samba SMB/CIFS server Possible solutions: Check on syntactic errors with . Set correct permissions for and restart : # chmod 0755 /var/cache/samba/msg Permission issues on SELinux SELinux not allow samba to access user home directories by default, to solve this, run: # setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs 1 Similarly, and make Samba has the ability to read or \"read and write\" all files. Permission issues on AppArmor If using a share path located outside of a home or usershares directory, whitelist it in . E.g.: No dialect specified on mount The client is using an unsupported SMB/CIFS version that is required by the server. See #Restrict protocols for better security for more information.

Sharing a folder fails It means that while you are sharing a folder from Dolphin (file manager) and everything seems ok at first, after restarting Dolphin the share icon is gone from the shared folder, and also some output like this in terminal ( Konsole ) output: \u2018net usershare\u2019 returned error 255: net usershare: usershares are currently disabled To fix it, enable usershare as described in #Enable Usershares . \"Browsing\" network fails with \"Failed to retrieve share list from server\" And you are using a firewall (iptables) because you do not trust your local (school, university, hotel) network. This may be due to the following: When the smbclient is browsing the local network it sends out a broadcast request on udp port 137. The servers on the network then reply to your client but as the source address of this reply is different from the destination address iptables saw when sending the request for the listing out, iptables will not recognize the reply as being \"ESTABLISHED\" or \"RELATED\", and hence the packet is dropped. A possible solution is to add: iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 137 -j CT --helper netbios-ns to your iptables setup. For Uncomplicated Firewall , you need to add to the end of the following line in IPT_MODULES=\"nf_conntrack_ftp nf_nat_ftp nf_conntrack_irc nf_nat_irc\" and then run the following commands as root: echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper ufw allow CIFS ufw reload To make this change persistent across reboots, add the following line at the end of : net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_helper=1 Protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE The client probably does not have access to shares. Make sure clients' IP address is in line in . Another problem could be, that the client uses an invalid protocol version. To check this try to connect with the where you specify the maximum protocol version manually: $ smbclient -U -L // -m <protocol version: e. g.

It is recommend to install the latest available upgrades on clients and deny access for unsupported clients. If you still need support for very old clients without NTLMv2 support (e.g. Windows XP), it is possible force enable NTLMv1, although this is not recommend for security reasons: If NTLMv2 clients are unable to authenticate when NTLMv1 has been enabled, create the following file on the client: This change also affects samba shares mounted with mount.cifs . If after upgrade to Samba 4.5 your mount fails, add the sec=ntlmssp option to your mount command, e.g. mount.cifs //server/share /mnt/point -o sec=ntlmssp,... See the man page: ntlmssp - Use NTLMv2 password hashing encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP message. The default in mainline kernel versions prior to v3.8 was sec=ntlm . In v3.8, the default was changed to sec=ntlmssp . Mapping reserved Windows characters Starting with kernel 3.18, the cifs module uses the \"mapposix\" option by default . When mounting a share using unix extensions and a default Samba configuration, files and directories containing one of the seven reserved Windows characters are listed but cannot be accessed. Possible solutions are: Use the undocumented mount option for cifs # mount.cifs //server/share /mnt/point -o nomapposix Configure Samba to remap (\"SFM\", Services for Mac) style characters to the correct native ones using fruit Manually remap forbidden characters using catia The latter approach (using catia or fruit) has the drawback of filtering files with unprintable characters.

Mount error: Host is down This error might be seen when mounting shares of Synology NAS servers. Use the mount option to solve it. Software caused connection abort File managers that utilizes can show the error when writing a file to a share/server.

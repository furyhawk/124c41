# Embedding

Embedding is a way to represent categorical variables in a way that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It is a way to represent a categorical variable as a continuous vector of numbers. This is done by creating a matrix of weights that is learned during the training process. The matrix is initialized randomly and updated during training. The embedding matrix is a dense representation of the categorical variable.

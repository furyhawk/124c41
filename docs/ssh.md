If the username on your local machine matches the one on the server you are trying to connect to, you can just type: ssh host_ip_address And hit Enter.
```sh

```

To open SSH port on Manjaro, you can follow these steps 1:

Make sure sshd (ssh daemon) is active and listening to incoming connections on the computer you are trying to access: systemctl status sshd If itâ€™s inactive, start it using: systemctl start sshd To automatically start it on boot: systemctl enable sshd

Also allow incoming connections in your firewall.

Software 
 Architecture: 
 The Hard Parts
Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed 
Architectures

## Introduction

There are no easy decisions in software architecture. Instead, there are many hard parts -- difficult problems or issues with no best practices -- that force you to choose among various compromises. The best design an architect can create is the least worst collection of trade-offs -- no single architecture characteristic excels as it would alone, but the balance of all the competing architecture characteristics promote project success.

## The Importance of Data in Architecture

It has been said that data is the most important asset in a company. Businesses want to extract value from the data that they have and are finding new ways to deploy data in decision making.

 - Operational data

    Data that is used to run the business. This data is defined as Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) data. Involves Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.

- Analytical data

    Data that is used to analyze the business. This data is defined as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data. Involves Read operations.

## Architectural Decisions Records

**ADR**: A short noun phrase containing the architecture decision

**Context**
In this section of the ADR we will add a short one- or two-sentence description of the problem, and list the alternative solutions.

**Decision**
In this section we will state the architecture decision and provide a detailed justification of the decision.

**Consequences**
In this section of the ADR we will describe any consequences after the decision is applied, and also discuss the trade-offs that were considered.
